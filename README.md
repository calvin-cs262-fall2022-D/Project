Our product aims to make viewing Calvin films and projects as easy as possible. Currently, there is not a place where you can find any student films. We hope to remedy this. With Knightflix, we will provide an app that puts all of Calvinâ€™s films from past and present into one spot. We will provide a place where it is easy to view all of your favorite Calvin art projects, whether it is film, art, or pictures. Knightflix provides a central location for all Calvin media projects, so they do not get lost in bigger platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.
