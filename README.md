# Knightflix
Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, HBO... what do all of these have in common? All of these greedy corporations are using exploiting viewers to gain money and profit. With overwhelming amounts of content and abundant streaming platforms, it is difficult for smaller films, (like student projects), to have a chance to shine. Knightflix gives regular students the opportunity to show their creative talent on a wider scale. Currently, there's no single place where you can find any student films. The only place that anyone can view art produced by Calvin students is in the Spoelhof basement. We hope to remedy this. With Knightflix, we will provide an app that puts all of Calvinâ€™s films from past and present into one spot. Knightflix allows you to share, favorite, and even recommend all of your favorite Calvin projects. Whether you've created film, art, or pictures, Knightflix believes that you have potential.
